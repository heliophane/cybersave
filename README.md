# Cybersave
A Windows program that manages saves for Cyberpunk 2077 when installed through GOG's offline installers

## Why does this exist?
I recently re-installed my computers operating system and went to install Cyberpunk 2077 through offline installers instead of using GOG Galaxy. I forgot to backup my saves and settings before re-installing and had to download Galaxy to retieve my saves. This program aims to wase that process by making an offline backup of the files pertaining to any saves you have and the settings you were using, and then implement them into your new installaion. 

## Goals
- Have a portable exe that cna be run before you move computers that backs up your saves to a compress file or folder that the user can move to an external drive or thumdrive
- Have the exe be able to be run on the new PC and move the saves and settings to the new game installation

## Aspirations(no promises)
- Have the saves back up to a user cloud provider of choice and be able to pull from said provider (Onedrive, Nextcloud, etc...)
- Support more games from GOG (CDPR Games should be easy as thy mostly save to the same folder, other games like Disco Elysium use a custom location)
